# Project Setup Instructions

## Required Data and Weights

To run this project correctly, you must download and place the required **data** and **trained model weights** in the appropriate folders.

### 1. Data Folder

You must have a folder named **`data`** at the root of the project.

Download the data from the following Google Drive link:

### 2. Weights Folder

You must also have a folder named **`weights`** containing the pretrained models.

Download the trained models from:

## Notes

- Make sure the folder names are exactly **`data`** and **`weights`**.
- Do not rename files inside these folders unless you also update the code accordingly.
- Both folders must be present before training or evaluation.

Once these folders are in place, you are ready to run the project.
